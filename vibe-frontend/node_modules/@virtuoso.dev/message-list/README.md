# React Virtuoso Message List

The `VirtuosoMessageList` is a React component built specifically for human/chatbot conversations. In addition to virtualized rendering out of the box, the component exposes an imperative data management API that gives you the necessary control over the scroll position when older messages are loaded, new messages arrive, or when the user submits a message. The scroll position can change instantly or with a smooth scroll animation.
