  This is a large feature that requires both backend and frontend work. Let me follow the full-stack-dev workflow:

1. Create task in vibe-kanban
2. Read CLAUDE.md
3. Create planning documents
4. Create feature branch
5. Implement
6. Validate
7. Commit, push, merge, cleanup
8. Link docs and mark done
8.
