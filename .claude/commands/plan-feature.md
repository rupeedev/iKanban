Start planning a new feature. Before any implementation:

1. Read the current plan.md file
2. Clear previous content and create a new plan with:
   - **Overview**: What we're building (from user's request)
   - **Goals**: 3-5 specific outcomes
   - **Approach**: Break into phases with concrete steps
   - **Technical Decisions**: Table of key choices
   - **Files to Modify**: List files that will be touched
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Checkboxes for done definition

3. Write the updated plan.md
4. Summarize the plan to the user and ask for approval before implementing
