Review the current file for:
- Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, auth bypass)
- Performance issues (unnecessary re-renders, N+1 queries)
- Code style violations (>400 lines, unused imports)
- Missing error handling
- TypeScript strict mode violations

Be concise. List issues as bullet points with line numbers.
